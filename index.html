                <h1>Tossed <span id="salad">SALAD</span> </h1>
                <p>This is probably what you think of when you think "salad." Tossed salads are made by tossing
                    ingredients (and usually dressing) in a haphazard way, so that they end up evenly mixed. </p>

                <h1>Composed <span id="salad">SALAD</span> </h1>
                <p>Composed salads are, well, composed. While the ingredients in a tossed salad are thrown together with
                    dressing, the ingredients in a composed salad are carefully assembled from the ground up with a
                    certain structure in mind. </p>

                <h1>Bound <span id="salad">SALAD</span> </h1>
                <p>Bound salads are held together with a binding agent like mayonnaise or a thick dressing. They look a
                    bit different than traditional composed or tossed salads, as vegetables aren't a requirement. This
                    is a kind of salad you'll often find at traditional picnics or potlucks. </p>
